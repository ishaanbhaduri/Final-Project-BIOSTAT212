- /do has the .do file used for this project. It contains all code used, including to convert datafiles and create the final Microsoft Word document.
- /output contains all the output running the .do file results in, including tables, images, edited .dta files. The "final" output is the Microsoft Word document "Bhaduri_Hypertension_Analysis.docx".
